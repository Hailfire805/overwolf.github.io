### API and Platform

* New API - [overwolf.settings.hotkeys](settings/hotkeys).  
  Returns an object with hotkeys methods and events.
  * New manifest flag: `hold`: Will be added to the [hotkeys object](manifest#hotkeys).  
    Defines a new type of hotkey - hotkey that works only while you are holding the key.  
    The flag also added to our [manifest schema file](https://github.com/overwolf/community-gists/blob/master/manifest-schema.json).
