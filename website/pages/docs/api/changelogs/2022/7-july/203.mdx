Known website issues:
- "view all search results" is sometimes broken

Fixed:
- Changelogs are now indexed properly when searching.

#### Platform
- [overwolf.streaming.StreamMouseCursor] now also supports a value of `none`, to never capture the cursor anywhere.
- New API
    - **Applies to discord and reddit only.**
    - [overwolf.social.*.uploadVideo](/api/social/reddit#uploadvideouploadvideoparameters-callback-callback) - Upload a video to the buffer server, getting a link to the raw file.
    - [overwolf.social.*.cancelUpload](/api/social/reddit#canceluploadid-callback) - Cancel a video's upload using its id.
    - [overwolf.social.*.post](/api/social/reddit#postredditshareparams-callback) - Make a post to the relevant social network. Using a link to an uploaded video will "embed" it in the post.
- **[overwolf.social.reddit.RedditShareParameters](/api/social/reddit#redditshareparameters-object) - `description` renamed to `content`**

#### Bug Fixes
- [overwolf.media.replays.ReplayVideoOptions](/api/media/replays#replayvideooptions-object) is no longer required when empty.
- Fixed a crash involving windows compatiability mode and overwolf.
