## September 13th 2023 - Improved Sidebar Navigation

We have released an update to the website's Sidebars, aiming to achieve the following:
- Make it easier to tell the sidebar item for the currently active page
- Make it easier to visualize the item hierarchy
- Improve support for content tagging (Relevant platforms, content type, etc)
- Cleaner design
- Various code improvements for upcoming updates

As per usual, we hope these changes improve your experience using the website,
and would love to hear any feedback you have on them!
