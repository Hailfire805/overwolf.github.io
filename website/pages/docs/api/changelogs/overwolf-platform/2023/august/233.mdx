* Note that iterations 231-233 were combined into a single version.

### Platform
- Various fixes for crashes that would happen on unexpected client states.
- Improved game detection for games running on DX12.
- Added support for the `traditional chinese` language in the client.

### API
- New API - [`overwolf.streaming.getActiveRecordingApps()`](/api/streaming#getactiverecordingappscallback)
  - Returns which apps are currently using the [`overwolf.streaming`](/api/streaming) recording engine, if any.
- Updated result for [`overwolf.streaming.start()`](/api/streaming#start) - [`overwolf.streaming.StreamResult`](/api/streaming#streamresult-object)
  - Added the [`activeRecordingApps`](/api/streaming#streamresult-object) parameter, which will contain which other app is already using the
  [`overwolf.streaming`](/api/streaming) recording engine, and if so, which app.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where the [`overwolf.streaming`](/api/streaming) recording engine would stay on if the app that called it crashed.
