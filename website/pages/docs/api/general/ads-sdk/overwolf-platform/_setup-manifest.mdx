### Changes to your app’s manifest.json

#### Set permissions

The Overwolf Advertising library uses Overwolf APIs to improve ad targeting for users. Therefore you should add the following permissions to your app’s manifest.json file:

```json
"permissions": ["Extensions", "Streaming", "Profile", "GameInfo"]
 ```
#### Enable Google’s syndication

In order to get impression tracking to work, you will also need to enable a work-around that allows requests to Google’s syndication servers. This is done by setting `"protocol_override_domains" : {"googlesyndication" : "http"}`, under the manifest.json "data" property:
 
```json
 "data": {    
    "protocol_override_domains" : {"googlesyndication" : "http"}
    }
 ```

#### Set manifest flags

The following App Window Data flags should be set to `true`:

* [block_top_window_navigation](/api/manifest#windows-block_top_window_navigation) -  Stop non `_blank <a>` ads from "taking-over" the entire app’s window.
* [popup_blocker](/api/manifest#popup_blocker) – Prevents new browser windows from being opened automatically using scripts.
* [mute](/api/manifest#windows-mute) - Mute sounds in window.
