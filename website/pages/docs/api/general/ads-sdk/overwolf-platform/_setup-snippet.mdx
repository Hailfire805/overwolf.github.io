In order to use the Ads SDK within an Overwolf app, you must first fetch it from a [constant endpoint](https://content.overwolf.com/libs/ads/latest/owads.min.js).
Attached is a short example snippet that fetches the SDK, as well as setting up a basic `OwAd` instance:

```html title="Fetch the latest version of the Ads-SDK, and make sure it loaded"
<script src="https://content.overwolf.com/libs/ads/latest/owads.min.js" async onload="onAdsSDKReady()"></script>
<script>
    // Set a timeout to check that onAdsSDKReady() was called.
    // If this is reached first, something probably went wrong with loading the owads.min.js script.
    setTimeout(() => {
        if (!OwAd) {
            // Reached if the SDK's script took too long to load.
            // If this happens, it is up to the app to decide how to proceed.
            console.error("Couldn't load owads.min.js!");
        }
    }, 20000);

    function onAdsSDKReady() {
        if (!OwAd) {
            // Reached if the SDK's script failed to properly load.
            // If this happens, it is up to the app to decide how to proceed.
            return;
        }
        // You can now create however many ad containers you need for this window.
        let adContainer = new OwAd(document.getElementById(/*Insert ad container Id here*/));
    }

</script>
```

#### Notes regarding the snippet above

* As you can see, the script tag is added with an `async` attribute.
This means that the script should be loaded asynchronously, so that it will not interfere
with the rest of the page's loading.
The downside for this is that the script may take time to load and be ready,
and may not be immediately available. To overcome this, you should use the `onload`
attribute of it, and privde it with the name of a function to be called when the script
has finished loading. In the above example, this is done in `onAdsSDKReady()`.

* When creating a new `OwAd()`, we provide it with a DOM element, which will serve as its container.
In this example we are getting the instance of the element by calling `document.getElementById()`.
However, you may use any other way to get the DOM element. You may use `document.querySelector`,
jQuery, or any other framework you wish. As long as the provided element is an HTML element available
at the DOM, it will work.
:::tip
If the container does not have an ID, it will automatically be assigned one.
