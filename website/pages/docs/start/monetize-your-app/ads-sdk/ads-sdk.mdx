:::tip About Ads
This page discusses the Overwolf Ads SDK and its specific implementation details.
If you haven't already, do also check out [**Working with Ads**][working-with-ads], for an overview
of what working with Ads entails on the app design level.
:::

The Overwolf Ads SDK, is a JavaScript library that allows app developers to show Ads inside their applications.
Overwolf manages, filters, and hosts these ads, which are then served in the app through the SDK.

## Getting Started

:::info Ad Enablement
Ads will be served to your app only after Overwolf enables them for you.
To get started with implementing and enabling ads, please follow our [working with Ads][working-with-ads] guidelines.

Before Ads are enabled for your app, you still can (and should) test their behavior in your app.
You can find more details about using a placeholder Ad for testing [here](../test-your-app/how-to-test-your-app#ads).

import Setup from "@site/pages/docs/api/general/ads-sdk/_setup.mdx"

## Guidelines for ad integration

Unfortunately, the advertising industry is still mostly designed to work with normal web pages, rather than
single page desktop apps. This means that we are often limited in how we can interact with, or display ads.

For example, app behavior is at risk of flagging fraud protection solutions used by our advertising
partners. To prevent this from happening, make sure:

- Your Ad container is ALWAYS visible in the app screen. Invisible, hidden, or cut-off Ad containers increase your app's risk. 
  - _For specific cases where you wish to **temporarily** stop displaying ads, you can set the `visibility` css property of the ads_
    _ parent div to 0. This will stop the container from displaying ads, until it is made visible again._
- Your Ad container's position is static and absolute, and does not move under any circumstances in its window.
- Your Ad container does not change/move when moving between different menus/pages of the app's window that both have a similar container.
- Your Ad container has no scrollbar, and is not scrollable.
- Once a new OwAd object is created, you should **NEVER** modify any of its containers' CSS properties. Changing container properties can
cause ads to stop displaying properly, or even be flagged for fraud. This mainly includes (but is not limited to):
  - Dimensions
  - Opacity
  - Display style
  - Z-Index

{/* :::tip Sample app
The ads-sample demonstrates the usage in the ads API, how to display an ad in an in-game window and desktop window, when to hide it, when to restore it, etc.
In our [APIs sample apps repository](https://github.com/overwolf/apis-sample-apps), you can find and download a  sample app.
::: */}

The following scenarios and principles are demonstrated in the Ads sample app:

* Position and Dimensions:  
  * Ads box is implemented in the top-level component with absolute positioning.
  * Ad container is <= container div, so the ad won't cut.
  * Ad box is fixed and without scroll bar.
  * Ads box is not refreshed when navigating components inside the same window. 
  * The ad placement area is not scrollable.
  * Tabs: Ads box is not refreshed when switching tabs, and its position is permanently kept.
  * No menus or pop-up windows on top of the ad.
  * Ad placement dimensions are being kept while resizing the app window. 
* Clickable:
  * Ads are clickable, and clicking on an ad will open the pre-defined browser (OW or user browser, as set in the manifest).
* DPI: 
  * The app proportions, and ads dimensions are not cut on DPI 125% / 150% and resolutions.
