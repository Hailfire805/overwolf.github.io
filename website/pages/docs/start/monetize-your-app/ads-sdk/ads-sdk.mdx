:::tip About Ads
This page discusses the Overwolf Ads SDK and its specific implementation details.
If you haven't already, do also check out [**Working with Ads**][working-with-ads], for an overview
of what working with Ads entails on the app design level.
:::

The Overwolf Ads SDK is a JavaScript library that allows app developers to show Ads inside their applications.
Overwolf manages, filters, and hosts these ads, which are then served in the app through the SDK.

## Getting Started

:::info Ad Enablement
Ads will be served to your app only after Overwolf enables them for you.
To get started with implementing and enabling ads, please follow our [working with Ads][working-with-ads] guidelines.

Before Ads are enabled for your app, you still can (and should) test their behavior in your app.
You can find more details about using a placeholder Ad for testing [here](../test-your-app/how-to-test-your-app#ads).

import Setup from "@site/pages/docs/api/general/ads-sdk/_setup.mdx"

## Guidelines for ad integration

If you haven't already, please give a read to [Ad planning guidelines](ads-sdk/working-with-ads#ad-planning-guidelines).

Apart from those, there are also certain things you should keep in mind when interacting with the actual Ad containers, on a more technical front:

- Your Ad container's minimum width and height should be >= The largest Ad container size selected for this container.
- Your Ad container element should have no child elements apart from the one generated by the SDK.
- Your Ad container should ALWAYS be visible in the app screen.
  - _For specific cases where you wish to **temporarily** stop displaying Ads, you can set the `display` css property of the Ad's_
    _ container to `none`. This will stop the container from displaying Ads, until it is made to display again._
- Your Ad container's position should be static and absolute, and it should not move **within** the window under any circumstances.
- If a window has multiple views, make sure its Ads containers do not change/move when moving between different menus/pages/views.
  - If you must change these containers, **do not recycle them!**. Instead, shut each changed container down, and open a new one in the new target location!
- Your Ad container should have no scrollbars, and should not be scrollable.
- Once a new OwAd object is created, you should **NEVER** modify any of its containers' CSS properties. The only property you **can** change is `display`, as mentioned in bullet 1.
- If you wish to **remove** an Ad container, **you must call `OwAd.shutdown()`!** Common use cases include:
  - Needing to "move" the Ad container - Done by shutting down the current one, and then creating a new one.
  - Needing to remove an Ad container - Done by just shutting down the current one.

{/* :::tip Sample app
The ads-sample demonstrates the usage in the ads API, how to display an ad in an in-game window and desktop window, when to hide it, when to restore it, etc.
In our [APIs sample apps repository](https://github.com/overwolf/apis-sample-apps), you can find and download a  sample app.
::: */}

The following scenarios and principles are demonstrated in the Ads sample app:

* Position and Dimensions:  
  * Ads box is implemented in the top-level component with absolute positioning.
  * Ad container is <= container div, so the ad won't cut.
  * Ad box is fixed and without scroll bar.
  * Ads box is not refreshed when navigating components inside the same window. 
  * The ad placement area is not scrollable.
  * Tabs: Ads box is not refreshed when switching tabs, and its position is permanently kept.
  * No menus or pop-up windows on top of the ad.
  * Ad placement dimensions are being kept while resizing the app window. 
* Clickable:
  * Ads are clickable, and clicking on an ad will open the pre-defined browser (OW or user browser, as set in the manifest).
* DPI: 
  * The app proportions, and ads dimensions are not cut on DPI 125% / 150% and resolutions.
