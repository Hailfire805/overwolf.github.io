Overwolf requires that only advertisements displayed or distributed through Overwolf’s proprietary advertising platform may be displayed or distributed through Overwolf applications.
If you manage an external website, you may not implement 3rd party iframes with Ads inside the Overwolf application.

**Use Forgivable Ads.** In some more words, don’t create ad experiences that you would not stand for as a gamer.
Ads present a challenge and tend to provoke negative responses, but they are critical to our economy and our ability to create great apps.
In general, talk to us if you're worried or unsure about your app's experience. 

Advertisers need to get continuous value from advertising on Overwolf,
so to keep the CPMs high and to get more advertisers on the platform we need to provide a high-quality
experience. With time, we found that it's not only about the [right time and place](https://medium.com/overwolf/a-new-way-for-brands-to-engage-with-gamers-ca4cfafc5d41),
but also about advertising in a balanced way.

To get a more general idea, we follow the industry Standards, Guidelines & Best Practices which are provided by the IAB. We also constantly scan our traffic with 3rd party anti-fraud tools to monitor quality and spot issues.
