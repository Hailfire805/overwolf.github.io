:::tip About The Ads SDK
This page discusses general information about working with Ads.
Once you are done, do also check out the [**Ads SDK**][ads-sdk], for an overview of the Overwolf Ads SDK.
:::

> "Ads offer a way to monetize your app with minimal changes to user experience, while still keeping it completely free."
 
More specifically, Ads allow you to take unused visual space in your app, and "auction" it off to advertisers,
who will then use it in order to advance their products.

While this can be very useful as a developer, there are some constraints to the app's design that come with Ads. Mainly:
- Ads cannot compromise the app's usability/design too much, otherwise user experience will be hurt.
- Ads must follow many rigid rules, set forth by the advertising industry.

In this page, we will take a deeper look at how to keep these two conflicting notions in check.

## Ads in desktop apps
[tl;dr][ad-guidelines]

In order to display Ads in an app, first you need to define one (or several) places where Ads will be shown.
This is where the first conflict between app design constraints comes.

### From a design perspective

Ideally, we want to use any dead space in the app's screens to display Ads:
- Unused margins.
- Annoying corners.
- Areas often hidden by other windows.
- etc.

### From an advertiser perspective

Ads come with many rigid constraints, to ensure that advertisers get a good return on their investment.
These most often dictate that:
- Ads must come in one of several [preset container sizes][ad-sizes].
- Ads must not move while playing.
- Ads must not actively compete with eachother.
- Ads must either be fully visible, or not visible at all.

There are also several further constraints placed by Overwolf on Ads displayed through the SDK, in order to maintain an ideal
environment for advertisers. You can read those [here](./advertising-policy).

As a result of all those constraints, we have devised a basic set of rules, to help you implement Ads into your app properly,
while keeping all sides as satisfied as can be.

### Ad planning guidelines

First, if you haven't already, review the available [Ad Sizes][ad-sizes].

Now, with this list in mind, you should select the locations in the app where these Ad containers will be displayed. Keep in mind:
- **Any window containing an Ad container, should also have real, tangible and continous value for the user.**
  - Some examples of where Ads must **never** be displayed:
    - App signup/login windows
    - App error windows
    - Windows displaying just the Ad container.
- Try to keep the Ads as acceptable and non-invasive to the app's overall experience as possible.
  - There is nothing wrong with using Ads. However, too many Ads, or parts of the app that feel like
  they are only there to show more Ads, are the main causes of friction with user experience when using Ads.
- The amount of Ad containers you can use is limited. **Use it wisely**. More specifically:
  - With video Ads, you may only have one active video Ad container at any moment **per app window**.
  - Each app window may only have up to (**or exactly**) 3 active Ad containers at any given moment (both video and display Ads count towards that limit).
  - You may use as many display Ad containers as you want, **as long as the total amount of Ad containers in the window stays at 3 or less.**
- If a certain app window has several views, try to make sure Ad locations do not change when moving between views.
(This ensures that the containers can stay active, regardless of the current view).
- Ads should be placed where they won't be hidden. If your app utilizes pop-ups, try to make sure that these do not block any Ad containers.
- Ads should be placed where they will be seen for more than a short moment.
  - This can often be achieved by using "dead" moments in games (i.e. loading screens, post-game screens, respawn timers, etc.).
- When using video Ad containers, try to keep the container's continuous visibility duration high, to ensure higher completion rates.
  - A good average open time for video Ads is 30 seconds.
  - A good average completion rate for video Ads (the rate of video Ads that were watched 100% of the way) is 70%.

## Implementing Ads with the Ads SDK

Once you have finished going over the [Ad planning guidelines][ad-guidelines], and have selected
where you want Ads to appear in your app, there are a few more steps you need to take until you can show live Ads in your app.

1. If you haven't already, please check out the [Overwolf Ads SDK][ads-sdk], and begin implementing it in the app.
2. [Contact our team][contact-us], to be provided a test Ad you can use to verify Ad integration in your app.
3. Once the integration is ready, our team will perform a final series of tests, to make sure that everything is working as intended.
4. If everything passes, Ads will be enabled and served for users of your app (video Ads will take a few days longer to be enabled).

:::tip Tracking Ad Performance
Once Ads are enabled for your app, Ad-related data will show up in your app's [developer's console dashboard](/tools/developers-console/all-applications/dashboard).

**You will also receive access to a dedicated dashboard with extra Ad performance analytics.**

:::info Demographics
* Advertising budgets are more significant for Tier 1 countries: US, UK, CA, AU, DE.
* If most of your app's users originate from Tier 1 countries, itâ€™s likely that your CPM and yield will be higher.
* We monetize ads in lower tier countries too, but from a revenue perspective, 
our recommendation is to focus your **marketing** efforts on Tier 1 countries to maximize your revenues.
