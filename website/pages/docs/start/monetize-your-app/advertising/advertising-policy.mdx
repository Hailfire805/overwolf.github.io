Overwolf is committed to maintaining a safe and productive advertising platform, and we work tirelessly to maintain it, both in-house, as well as with Advertising companies and App developers.

In order to ensure that this environment is maintained, we ask app developers to make sure that you comply with the following policy:
- Only advertisements displayed or distributed through Overwolfâ€™s proprietary advertising platform may be displayed or distributed through Applications.
  - If you manage an external website, you may not implement 3rd party `<iframes/>` with Ads inside of your Overwolf application.
- Use Forgivable Ads:
  - Do not create Ad experiences that are actively intrusive/clash with the app's basic usage.
  - No more than one video Ad container may be placed on a single page at any moment.
  - Do not refresh/reload a page unneccessrily while the user is still engaged with it.
  - Any manipulation of ads is not allowed - Bots, auto clickers, faking impressions etc.
  - Ads may not be placed on dead end/empty screens. This includes:
    - "Thank You" pages
    - "Login" pages
    - "Dialogue/Error" pages
    - Etc

To get a general idea, Overwolf follows the industry Standards, Guidelines & Best Practices provided by the [IAB](https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ad-Format-Guidelines_DV-CTV.pdf).

We also constantly scan our Ads traffic with 3rd party anti-fraud and viewability tools, to ensure that quality is kept high, and that issues are swiftly dealt with.

:::tip Forgivable Ads
Ads present a challenge, as they tend to provoke negative responses from users. However, they are critical to our economy, and our ability to support the many great apps
created by the community.

As such, always remember - do not create Ad experiences you would not stand for as a gamer using your app.
