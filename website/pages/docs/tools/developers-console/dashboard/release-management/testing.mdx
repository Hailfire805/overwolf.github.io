Here, you can get an overview the testing channels of your app. These are custom channels,
and can only be downloaded from using a direct link. If a user downloads your app from the store,
they will instead download to the [Production Channel](./production).
![The Testing Tab](/assets/tools/developers-console/release-management/testing/index.jpg)

Under this tab, you can set up custom [**App Channels**](.#what-are-release-channels). These allow you to deploy different versions of your app to specific, hand-picked users.
For example:
- `Dev` - A "latest version" channel, that allows anyone in your team to test the latest development builds, for a faster development loop.
- `QA` - A channel for your QA team to thoroughly check the functionality and stability of new features.
- `Beta` - a channel for your app's beta testers, to get real feedback from trusted users about new features before releasing them to your entire userbase.

You can also set up "testing channels", in case you suspect a bug might have slipped in during a recent version, and wish to check if it exists on an older version.

## Creating a new App Channel

In order to create a new channel, simply click on the `Create channel` button at the top right of the screen. You will then be greeted by the following prompt.

![Create New Channel](/assets/tools/developers-console/release-management/testing/new-channel.jpg)

Then, pick a name for the new channel, and click `Save`. The new channel will now show up on the list.

![New Channel In List](/assets/tools/developers-console/release-management/testing/active-channels.jpg)

Now, if we go into any of these channels, by pressing `Manage` on its row, we will be greeted by a familiar screen.

![Channel 'new'](/assets/tools/developers-console/release-management/testing/channel-new.jpg)

Under "Channel details", we can see and edit the name of the channel.
We can also copy the URL required to download from this channel, by clicking on `Copy link` under `URL`.

The rest of the window allows us to [manage the channel](.#manage-an-app-channel) like any other channel.


### 1. The Testing tab




You can see the default `Production` release environment in the screenshot, where you can [deploy public version](submit-a-new-version#upload-new-app-version). Under it, you can see the `Testing` environment where you can deploy custom and beta versions of your app:

![production-and-testing](/assets/tools/developers-console/app-channels/production-and-testing.png)

Currently, there are no custom app channels for this app. Let's create one. Click on the "Create Channel" button.

The app channel creation modal will popup, and we will create an app channel named "Beta", for our testers team:

![production-and-testing](/assets/tools/developers-console/app-channels/create-channel-modal.png)

Now you can see that a new app channel is created, still, without any app that uploaded and released to this new channel:

![production-and-testing](/assets/tools/developers-console/app-channels/channels-list.png)

### 2. Upload an OPK to the channel

Precisely like you [submit a new version of your app](submit-a-new-version#3-upload-the-new-opk), you need to upload an OPk to the new channel (on our case, a beta version of your app with unreleased features that need to be tested). And distribute/phase it to the app channel subscribers.

Click the "Manage" button of the new channel (in our example, the "Beta" channel):

![production-and-testing](/assets/tools/developers-console/app-channels/manage-button.png)

Now you can see the good old OPK release page, where you can phase and release different app versions for this particular channel. Remember - that only the latest version is the "public" version distributed to the app channel subscribers whenever the app will get updated.

![production-and-testing](/assets/tools/developers-console/app-channels/drop-opk.png)

### 3. Get the download link

After uploading the OPK to the custom channel, you get get a custom link for downloading this specific app channel "flavor":

![production-and-testing](/assets/tools/developers-console/app-channels/copy-link.png)

:::note
The "start rollout to production" button will roll out the current version to the beta channel and not to your public/production main channel.
:::

After releasing a version to your new channel, you can go back to the channels list page and see which version is the "public" version of each channel. In our case, v3.0.9 is the released/public version of the "Beta" channel:

![channels-list-with-version](/assets/tools/developers-console/app-channels/channels-list-with-version.png)

## Download a custom channel version

There are two ways that your testers/users can get the custom app version from a speicif channel:

1. **Custom download link** - Get the custom download link from the dev console as [explained above](#3-get-the-download-link).  
  After creating a new channel and upload an app version into it, a custom download link is generated automatically. Clicking on it will download an EXE file which is the latest OW client bound to your app. Exactly like the download links from the store.

2. **API** - Use the API as [explained below](#the-app-channels-api) to change the current app channel, enabling you to integrate this feature in your app. For example, display a combo box that enables your app users to change the channel from the app's UI.

## Apply the channel change

After downloading the custom app version or changing the app channel, you will have to do ONE of the following to apply the change:

1. Restart OW client.
2. Wait up to four hours for the auto-update process to initiate.
3. Update the app through the API and relaunch it, using the recommended [extension update flow](/api/extensions#recommended-extension-update-flow).


## The App Channels API

You can implement the channels feature directly in your app using the app channels API. 

You can read the current installed channel of your app using [overwolf.settings.getExtensionSettings()](/api/settings#getextensionsettingscallback) (and display it in your app's UI for example).

```js
overwolf.settings.getExtensionSettings() //{"settings":{"channel":"beta"},"success":true}
```

You can change the current channel using [overwolf.settings.setExtensionSettings](/api/settings#setextensionsettingsextensionsettings-callback) (and enable your app users to change their app version for example).

```js
overwolf.settings.setExtensionSettings({ channel: "beta" })
```

## App Channels Sample App

You can download our [App Channels sample app](https://github.com/overwolf/api/s-sample-apps/tree/master) that demonstrates how to use the app channels feature and API.
