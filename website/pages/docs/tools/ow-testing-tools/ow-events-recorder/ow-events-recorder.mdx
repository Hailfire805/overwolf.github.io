This tool can be found over in the following [GitHub repository][download-link]
:::

The Overwolf Events Recorder allows Developers to record important API Events/Calls that happen to them in real time,
so they can then play them back during testing (using the [ow-events-tester][events-tester]), and ensure that their app properly responds to them.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the Game Events Recorder, simply download it from its [GitHub repository][download-link].

### Quickstart

To quickly get started using the recorder, run the following in your chosen terminal (using your preferred package manager):
```js
// Install all dependencies
npm i

// Build the application
npm run build
```

Once the `build` command finishes running, simply load the newly created `dist/` folder as an unpacked Overwolf application, and launch it.

You should now be greeted by the following screen, in which case, you can already start recording your Session:

![Start Recording](/assets/tools/ow-testing-tools/ow-events-recorder/start-recording.png)
*Simply click the red circle, and any API events/calls from the [supported list](#supported-apis) will be recorded!*

Then, once you are ready to stop recording, simply click the button again, and the recording will stop.

![Finished Recording](/assets/tools/ow-testing-tools/ow-events-recorder/finished-recording.png)
*You can then view, rename, or even delete the new recording, by hovering over it in the relevant screen*

This recording can then be used within the [Overwolf Events Tester][events-tester], in order to see how your app would act during this specific event sequence.


## Supported APIs

The Overwolf Events Recorder can currently include the following **Overwolf APIs***.

*\* Currently, only Overwolf APIs are supported. This means that external, game-based APIs, like the [League of Legends LCU](https://riot-api-libraries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lcu.html)
are not supported, and need to be appropriately mocked for these tests.*

### Supported API Events

The following events can be recorded (and then mimicked by the [Events Tester][events-tester])

- [`overwolf.games.onGameLaunched`](/api/games#ongamelaunched)
- [`overwolf.games.onGameInfoUpdated`](/api/games#ongameinfoupdated)
- [`overwolf.games.events.onGameInfoUpdated2`](/api/games/events#ongameinfoupdated2)
- [`overwolf.games.events.onNewEvents`](/api/games/events#onnewevents)
- [`overwolf.games.events.onError`](/api/games/events#onerror)
- [`overwolf.games.launchers.onLaunched`](/api/games/launchers#onlaunched)
- [`overwolf.games.launchers.onUpdated`](/api/games/launchers#onupdated)
- [`overwolf.games.launchers.onTerminated`](/api/games/launchers#onterminated)
- [`overwolf.games.launchers.events.onInfoUpdates`](/api/games/launchers/events#oninfoupdates)
- [`overwolf.games.launchers.events.onNewEvents`](/api/games/launchers/events#onnewevents)

### Supported API Calls

- [`overwolf.games.getRunningGameInfo()`](/api/games#getrunninggameinfocallback)
- [`overwolf.games.getRunningGameInfo2()`](/api/games#getrunninggameinfo2callback)
- [`overwolf.games.events.setRequiredFeatures()`](/api/games/events#setrequiredfeaturesfeatures-callback)
- [`overwolf.games.launchers.getRunningLaunchersInfo()`](/api/games/launchers#getrunninglaunchersinfocallback)
- [`overwolf.games.launchers.events.setRequiredFeatures()`](/api/games/launchers/events#setrequiredfeatureslauncherclassid-features-callback)


## Creating effective recordings

The Overwolf Events Recorder can record all Events and Calls made while a recording Session is running.
However, it cannot record things outside of that timeframe. As such, it is highly recommended that you carefully plan out your recordings,
and split them into types. For example:

### Mid-Session recordings

Mid-Session recordings are, recordings made in the middle of a game Session.
They do not include the entire chain of Events and Calls that has led the app to the current state,
but they do include specific set of Events and Calls that are relevant at this point.

For example:
- A recording of a game round where one person took out the entire enemy team.
- A recording of the character select phase.
- A recording of the post-match phase.

These recordings can be used to test specific App edge cases, by bringing it into
a game, putting it at a state where these recordings can reasonably happen, and then playing them.  
When carefully chained together, these can help you quickly test sequences of complicated edge cases with ease.

### Full-Session recordings

Full-Session recordings are, recordings made of a full game Session.
They include the entire chain of Events and Calls, from before the game first launched,
until after it was closed.

For example:
- A recording of a full game Session, when a quick match was played, and then the game was closed.
- A recording of a full long game Session, potentially spanning over several hours.
- A recording of a Session where multiple full game Sessions were played and switched between, at times without even closing the game.

These recordings can be used to test more general App flows, ensuring that it behaves as expected, end-to-end.
Paired up with the different playback tools included in the [Overwolf Events Tester](/ow-events-tester), these can significantly help automate tests.
