title: Game Events Convention
---

Game events allow applications to truly understand what is happening in a game, which in turn lets them deliver a significantly more accurate and adaptive experience.

## Event Types
### Game Events
Game events refer to fleeting changes in the game, and are rarely relevant past the exact moment they occur. Common examples include:
- Player kill
- Player assist
- Item obtained
- Achievement unlocked

**Game Events do not describe a change in the overall state of the game.**

Example:
```json title="The player just scored 5 points"
{
    "name": "score",
    "data": {
        "score": 5
    }
}
```

### Info Updates
Info update events refer to lasting changes in the game's state. Common examples include:
- Player name
- Player health
- Player inventory
- Current match

Info update events fire when a change occures to the overall state of the game.

The most recent game state is stored in a dictionary-like object, accessible to applications through the [`overwolf.games.events.getInfo()`](/api/games/events#getinfocallback) method.

Example:
```json title="A match just started, updating the match_state info"
{
    "game_info": {
        "match_state": {
            "in_progress": true
        }
    }
}
```

### Info Resetting

Info updates are events. However, they are not fired by in-game events. They are fired when the game's state directly changes.

As such, in order to ensure that these events fire, even if the information when it should, even if the data might not have changed, event "resets" are used.
This is done by temporarily changing the value to a clearly invalid value (usually `null` or `""`), and then changing it back to its current state.

The reset can then be ignored by the app as a clearly invalid value, and then the new value can be handled as a fresh update.

## Features

:::note Game Events SDK and Features
Currently, the [game events SDK](/topics/integrations/events-sdk-for-game-developers) does not natively support features.

For game developers - This means that this section is redundant.

For app developers - This means that SDK games will fire **all** game events, meaning that you can skip the [`setRequiredFeatures()`](/api/games/events#setrequiredfeaturesfeatures-callback) step.
:::

All events are grouped into `features`. Features serve as a way to group events based on their purpose. For example:
- `match_info` - Information about the current match.
- `death` - Death counters + Player death event.
- `abilities` - Events fired when the player uses an ability + Current ability levels.

An application then subscribes to the specific features it needs, and is only notified of those events.

:::tip
Info updates contain the feature they're a part of, meaning that it is safe to have several info updates that share the same name.
(however, it is not always recommended. More on that in [naming convention](#naming-convention)).

## Events Convention

In order to ensure that events stay consistent accross games, we have set a few guidelines in place.
These guidelines serve as the baseline for any new events introduced from now on.

### Naming Convention

> All events names should contain only lower-case letters, with underscores for word separation.




### Types Convention

:::note
This section is only relevant for game developers, as it discusses the exact formats for sending game data.
:::

In order to ensure a smoother integration for all sides involved, we have compiled a list of different data types and their preferred formats:

Raw Type            | Serialized Format | Note                |
--------------------| ------------------| --------------------|
boolean             | boolean           |                     |
number              | integer           |                     |
aplhanumeric values | string            | Values like internal names |
user-generated text | string (base64)   | Usernames, chat, and anything else that could include complex characters |
array[]             | array[]           | Arrays should be kept as arrays, and the contained values comply with the convention |
object              | object            | Objects should be kept as they are where logical, as long as their fields comply with the convention |
