Game events allow applications to truly understand what is happening in a game, which in turn lets them deliver a significantly more accurate and adaptive experience.

## Event Types
### Game Events
Game events refer to the moment at which a fleeting change occures in the game, and are rarely relevant past the exact moment they occur. Common examples include:
- Player kill
- Player assist
- Item obtained
- Achievement unlocked

**Game Events do not describe a change in the overall state of the game.**

Example:
```json title="A player just scored 5 points"
{
    "name": "score",
    "data": {
        "score": 5,
        "player": "User123"
    }
}
```

### Info Updates
Game Info refers to a persistent game state. Common examples include:
- Player name
- Player health
- Player inventory
- Current match

Info update events fire when a change occures to a certain Game Info, with the new value of that specific Game Info.

Game Info is stored in categories, that are then stored in a dictionary-like object, accessible to applications via the [`overwolf.games.events.getInfo()`](/api/games/events#getinfocallback) method.
Every Game Info item exists inside of a single category, and categories cannot be nested.

Example:
```json title="A match just started, updating the match_state game info inside of the match_info category"
{
    "match_info": {
        "match_state": {
            "in_progress": true,
            "match_id": 12512
        }
    }
}
```

```json title="The player's coin count changed to 5, updating the coins info inside of the player_inventory category"
{
    "player_inventory": {
        "coins": 5
    }
}
```

### Info Resetting

Info updates are events. However, they are not fired by in-game events. They are fired when their specific Game Info changes.

As such, in order to ensure that these events fire properly, even if the exact value might not have changed, event "resets" are used.
This is done by changing the value to a consistent, clearly invalid value (usually `null`), as soon as it becomes invalid.
Then, once the new value should be set, it is set, and a new event is fired.

The reset can then be ignored by the app, by being detected as a reset, and then the new value can be handled as a fresh update.

<summary>Example Reset</summary>

Assume that we have a `score`` Info Value. This value starts at 0 at the start of every match.

```json title="First match just started, score was set to 0"
...
    "score": 0
...
```

Now, it could be possible that a match will end with `score` still being set to 0. As a result, when the next match starts,
setting `score` to 0 will not fire an event.

To stop that from happening, when the match ends, we set `score`, and any other match-specific data, to null:

```json title="First match just ended, score is set to null"
...
    "score": null
...
```

Now, when the next match will start, score will change from null to 0, causing an event to fire.

```json title="Second match just started, score is set to 0"
...
    "score": null
...
```

## Features

:::note Game Events SDK and Features
Currently, the [game events SDK](/topics/integrations/events-sdk-for-game-developers) does not natively support features.

For game developers - This means that this section is redundant.

For app developers - This means that SDK games will fire **all** game events, meaning that you can skip the [`setRequiredFeatures()`](/api/games/events#setrequiredfeaturesfeatures-callback) step.
:::

All events are grouped into `features`. Features serve as a way to group events based on their purpose. For example:
- `match_info` - Information about the current match.
- `death` - Death counters + Player death event.
- `abilities` - Events fired when the player uses an ability + Current ability levels.

An application then subscribes to the specific features it needs, and is only notified of those events.

Game Info category names will always correspond to the relevant feature's name.

## Events Convention

In order to ensure that events stay consistent accross games, we have set a few guidelines in place.
These guidelines serve as the baseline for any new events introduced from now on.

### Naming Convention

> All events names should contain only lower-case letters, with underscores for word separation.




### Types Convention

:::note
This section is only relevant for game developers, as it discusses the exact formats for sending game data.
:::

In order to ensure a smoother integration for all sides involved, we have compiled a list of different data types and their preferred formats:

Raw Type            | Serialized Format | Note                |
--------------------| ------------------| --------------------|
boolean             | boolean           |                     |
number              | integer           |                     |
aplhanumeric values | string            | Values like internal names |
user-generated text | string (base64)   | Usernames, chat, and anything else that could include complex characters |
array[]             | array[]           | Arrays should be kept as arrays, and the contained values comply with the convention |
object              | object            | Objects should be kept as they are where logical, as long as their fields comply with the convention |
