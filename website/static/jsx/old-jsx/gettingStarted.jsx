            <h2>What can apps do?</h2>

            <p className="what-can-apps-do-intro">If you can imagine it, you can probably develop it.<br/> The possibilities are endless, but here are some of the most successful Overwolf app features to date:</p>

            <ul className="icons-list what-apps-do-list">
                <li className="highlights">
                    <h3>Highlights</h3>
                    <p>Automatically clip highlights based on in game events such as kills or deaths,<br/> making it easier than ever to show off one's skills.</p>
                </li>
                <li className="game-stats">
                    <h3>Game Stats</h3>
                    <p>Add in-game stats and enemy intel to top PC games,<br/> fuelling tactics and smarter plays.</p>
                </li>
                <li className="build-recommendations">
                    <h3>Build & Recommendations</h3>
                    <p>Provide recommendations for builds, loadouts, compositions or decks depending on the game in question.</p>
                </li>
                <li className="tournaments">
                    <h3>Tournaments</h3>
                    <p>Participate in user-organized tournaments and community challenges.</p>
                </li>
                <li className="easy-integration">
                    <h3>3rd Party Integration</h3>
                    <p>Integrate with services and platforms all over the globe.<br/> For instance, you can merge Overwolf in-game events with in-stream tools using the Twitch API.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Where apps live</h2>
            <p className="what-can-apps-do-intro">Apps can run in multiple modes which you should keep in mind when thinking about your concept:</p>

            <ul className="icons-list were-apps-live-list">
                <li className="in-game">
                    <h3>In-game</h3>
                    <p>Apps can appear during loading times, in the lobby, during respawn timers or otherwise when the player is free and not busy playing.<br/> A hotkey enables or disables in-game apps whenever the user wishes it.</p>
                </li>
                <li className="desktop">
                    <h3>Desktop</h3>
                    <p>When the gamer's not in-game, apps can still provide value, for example by enabling a desktop window for debriefing and researching one's performance after a long match.</p>
                </li>
                <li className="companion-screen">
                    <h3>Companion Screen</h3>
                    <p>More and more gamers use a second monitor while playing, and companies such as MSI, ASUS, HP and others are rushing to release companion screen laptops - Overwolf apps are already prepared to work as a second monitor solution.</p>
                </li>
                <li className="twitch-extension">
                    <h3>Twitch Extension</h3>
                    <p>Overwolf's apps are fully integratable with the Twitch API, so our tools can run on stream and communicate with streamers and viewer actions.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
